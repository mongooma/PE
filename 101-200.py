	Fact: Of an enclosed region, for every point X on the boundary B, there is an e_X point towards the "inside" of the region. From X going to X + d(X), the derivative vector being from v1 = (1, df(X)) to v2 = (1, df(X+d(X))), suppose v2 is rotated from v1 using the matrix R: v2 = R.dot(V1), then e_X+d(X) = e_X.dot(R) 

	------------------------

	Suppose the data is given as A(X_A, Y_A), B(X_B, Y_B), C(X_C, Y_C), go through the edges as A->B->C. No matter if the going-through is clockwise or counter-clockwise, first get e1 for AB, e1 is chosen as either of the two possible normal vectors:

	(-1, (B[0] - A[0])/B([1]-A[1])), (1, -(B[0] - A[0])/B[1]-A[1]))

	calculate R_AB_BC = [[cos(theta), -sin(theta)], 
					  [sin(theta), cos(theta)]]
				   = R_BC_I X (R_AB_I)^{-1} 
				   = [[AB[0]*BC[0]+AB[1]*BC[1], AB[1]*BC[0]-AB[0]*BC[1]], 
					  [AB[0]*BC[1]-AB[1]*BC[0], AB[0]*BC[0]+AB[1]*BC[1]]]

	# first rotate AB back to (x, 0) then rotate from (x, 0) to BC
	Notice the columns are exactly the image of the vectors. 

	Similarly compute the rotation matrix R_BC_CA. 

	R_BC_CA = [[BC[0]*CA[0]+BC[1]*CA[1], BC[1]*CA[0]-BC[0]*CA[1]], 
			   [BC[0]*CA[1]-BC[1]*CA[0], BC[0]*CA[0]+BC[1]*CA[1]]]

	Then e2 = R_AB_BC.dot(e1), e3 = R_BC_CA.dot(e2).
	
	* Refer to https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3563901/how-to-find-2d-rotation-matrix-that-rotates-vector-mathbfa-to-mathbfb
	about this part. 

	Then calculate sign(<e1, e1*>), sign(<e2, e2*>) and sign(<e3, e3*>) where e* is the normal vector pointed towards origin (0, 0) of respect edge vectors. But sign(<e, e*>) = sign(<e, p>), where p is (-x, -y) with arbitrary (x, y) on the edge. Therefore calculate s1 = sign(<e1, A>), s2 = sign(<e2, B>) and s3 = sign(<e3, C>). 

	If s1, s2, s3 all >=0 or <=0. Then the origin point is in the closed area.
		This will also fit for some node on the origin, or some edge on the origin.

	# find possible sum 
	# use Knapsack as a sub-routine
	# binary search (determine a maxval and a minval)
	"""

	"""
	This problem has several key components:
	1. Limit the search. 
		According to the traditional way of solving EP problems, we have to search in the solution space. Infinite and heuristically growing the solution will not lead to meaningful comparison. 
		There is no explanation to why the lowest n of S_k should be in the middle of the previous S_k-1. So suppose we search the 7 numbers within the interval [1, MAXINT]

	
	2. Construct the ordering:
		2.1 Efficiently compare the subsets in the power set. Find an ordering of these comparisons.

		2.2 Find the growth/deduction function between finding S_k-1 and S_k. Since clearly a successful S_k indicates a successful S_k-1, so every successful S_k is constructed from a successful S_k-1. 


	Now we separately target the components:
		
	1. (1) Suppose we have found a S_k = 7 * En, then we could stop searching for the min_n = E_n.
	   (2) According to 2.2 (1), we order the search branches from the lowest possible n_k to the highest. However, when we have found a S_k from an earlier path, we should not stop the further searches. Since such occasion might exist:

	   		n_11, n_12, n_13, ...,          n_1k
	   		n_21, n_22,      n_23, ..., n_2k   * better solution
	
	2. 	
		2.1 If every m-set having sum larger than all m-1-set, then every m-set will have sum larger than l-set, 0<l<=m-1; and also every p-set will have sum larger than all m-1-set, k>=p>=m.
		Therefore, for a k-set, we only need to guarentee every m-set having sum larger than all m-1-set, m=2, 3, 4, ..., k. 
			That is, min(m-set) > max(m-1-set). 
				(1) That is, {n_1, n_2, ..., n_m} > {n_k-(m-2), ..., n_k-1, n_k}

		2.2 Without loss of generality, let's grow S_k from the right of S_k-1. (But notice we will not necessary grow S*_k from S*_k-1 this way) Suppose we have S_k-1:

			n_1, n_2, ..., n_k-1

		And we need to have
			n_k-2 + n_k-1 > n_k
		But a better limit would be
			n_1 + n_2 > n_k

		(1) So we search between [n_k-1 + 1, n_1 + n_2 - 1] for n_k. Ordering the next searches from the lowest to the highest in possible n_k. 
		n_k has to be larger than n_k-1 because if we have a S_k = {n_1, n_2, ..., n*_k, n_k-1} then we have messed up the ordering of the search. That is, this search result should be on a different branch.

		(2) Therefore, by keep growing S_k from S_k-1 in this way, we will have disjoint search branches with no redundancie. 

			2.2.1 Find a possible construction for S_3:
			Since every 2-set will have sum larger than the 1-set, we have a possible S_3:
				n, n+1, 2n+2 for k = 3 (when n=1, optimal)
			(1) Actually, the general construction for S_3 is
				* n, n+m, [max(m, n+m+1)=n+m+1, 2n+m] for arbitrary n, m
			where we start the searches from.
